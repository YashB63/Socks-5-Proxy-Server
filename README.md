# Socks-5-Proxy-Server
A Socks5 proxy server is a type of proxy server that uses the Socks5 protocol to route network traffic between a client and a server. This protocol provides authentication and encryption, which helps to ensure the security and privacy of the communication.
Socks5 (Socket Secure 5) is a protocol used for proxy servers that enables clients to bypass internet restrictions and increase their online security and privacy. 
Socks5 proxy servers can be used to bypass internet censorship, access geographically restricted content, and improve online anonymity. They are commonly used in online gaming, torrenting, and accessing streaming services that are not available in certain regions.
One of the main benefits of using a Socks5 proxy server is its ability to handle different types of traffic, including TCP, UDP, and DNS. This means that users can enjoy faster speeds and greater reliability compared to other types of proxy servers.
